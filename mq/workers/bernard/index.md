You can use IronMQ as a highly available message broker for Bernard.

It's easy:

1. Add `bernard/bernard` to your `composer.json` file.
2. Configure Bernard to use the correct driver which is [explained here](http://bernardphp.com/en/latest/docs/drivers.html#ironmq).

That's pretty much it, now use Bernard as normal! More info at: [bernardphp.com](http://bernardphp.com)
