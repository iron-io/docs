# IronMQ Documentation

IronMQ is a scalable, reliable, high performance message queue in the cloud. Forget about setting up and scaling complicated message queue infrastructure because
IronMQ is a **completely hosted** platform meaning **zero servers**.

## Getting Started

To start using Iron.io services, you need to sign up and get an oauth token:

* [Sign Up](http://www.iron.io)
* [Get an Oauth Token](http://hud.iron.io/tokens)

Now you're ready to start using our IronMQ.

IronMQ supports multiple interfaces such as [Beanstalkd](http://kr.github.com/beanstalkd) and our own [HTTP interface](/mq/code/libraries).

## Client Libraries

In most cases you'll want to use one of the available client libraries.

* [Clients for our REST/HTTP API](/mq/code/libraries)
* All [beanstalkd clients](https://github.com/kr/beanstalkd/wiki/client-libraries) work too so you can use IronMQ with all popular languages, but be sure to read our [Beanstalkd page](/mq/code/beanstalkd) for information on how to authenticate.
