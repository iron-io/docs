Workers are just sections of discrete, modular code that you queue tasks against.
It's rare, though, that you want to run the same code repeatedly with no changes or variables.
To address this, IronWorker has the concept of a "payload".
The payload is the same thing, conceptually, as an argument or variable that is passed to a
function, method, or command â€”
just a piece of information you want to supply at runtime and make available in the worker itself.

Client is able to specify payload for queued or scheduled workers.
Payloads are strings. But usually we suggest to use JSON format.
Also, when using `ruby` or `php` runtimes JSON payload will be automatically parsed.

## Get Payload in a Worker

If payload is specified on worker queue or schedule store it in the database.
Before worker will be launched in our [environment](worker/reference/environment)
the payload is put to the instance as file.
The payload is stored in a file in the worker's directory when the worker is queued,
and the location of that file is passed to the worker using the `-payload` command line flag.
To get the contents of your payload, you need to:

1. Read the `-payload` flag using `ARGV` (or whatever your language uses to read command line flags)
2. Open and read the file specified by the `-payload`> flag
3. Parse the contents of the file (for example, if you encoded the payload when queuing the task)

Workers which use `ruby` and `php` runtime have more possibilities to access the payload.

#### Access to a Payload in Ruby Runtime

When worker is in Ruby it has access to special methods to obtain payload.

<div class="language ruby">
{% highlight ruby %}
payload_string = payload # string
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

If specified payload is in JSON format it will be parsed automatically.

<div class="language ruby">
{% highlight ruby %}
parsed_payload = params # parsed JSON
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

#### Access to a Payload in PHP Runtime

The payload in PHP runtime is accessible by calling method `getPayload()`.
If payload is parsable JSON string it will be converted automatically.

<div class="language php">
{% highlight php %}
<?php
payload = getPayload(); // parsed JSON or string
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

## Other Information

Your worker will also be passed `-id` and `-d` command line arguments.
The value of `-id` will be the ID of the task that is currently being executed,
and the value of `-d` will be the user-writable directory
that can be used for temporary storage for the duration of the task's execution.
