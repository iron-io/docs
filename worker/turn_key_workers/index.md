Turn key workers are pre-made workers you can add to your account and start using immediately. No coding required and you
can use them from any language.

The basic usage for all of these is:

1. iron_worker upload http://github.com/PATH_TO_WORKER_FILE
2. Queue up tasks for the worker or schedule it.

That's it!  Super easy, super powerful. [See this blog post on shareable workers for more background.](http://blog.iron.io/2012/11/sharable-open-source-workers-for.html)
