Webhooks are used with IronWorker to trigger a worker based on an event. This guide is specific to the webhook generated by IronWorker when a task changes state (complete, error, timeout, cancelled) so you can be notified and trigger a responsive action.

<h2 id="start">Getting Started</h2>
To use the Webhook integration, you'll need an endpoint for the webhook to deliver a request. A great tool for testing HTTP endpoints is <a href="http://requestb.in/">requestb.in</a>. Select 'Create a Request Bin' to generate a temporary webhook uri. You'll need this link for the Iron.io HUD.

<h2 id="uri">Enter Webhook URI</h2>
With your webhook uri, head over to the Iron.io HUD. Navigate to your Profile and select the Integrations menu. Select the 'Add' button for Webhooks and copy the link in the field. Selecting 'Activate' will associate the uri.

<h2 id="activate">Activate the Webhooks Integration</h2>
Once you have associated the webhook uri with Iron.io, you can activate the integration for a specific project. Selecting the Integrations icon (plug), will display a list of services you have authenticated with. Find Webhooks and toggle the switch button on to activate the integration.

<h2 id="Test">Test the Integration</h2>
With the webhook uri associated and activated, any IronWorker task state change will trigger the webhook. To test, write, upload, and run a simple task. Once complete, refresh the Request Bin url to inspect the request.
