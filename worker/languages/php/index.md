PHP has grown to be one of the most popular languages to write web software in.
You can add some power to your current PHP application using PHP workers on IronWorker.
This article will help you get started with PHP workers, but you should be familiar with the [basics of IronWorker](/worker).

## Quick Start

### Get the CLI

We've created a [command line interface](/worker/reference/cli) to the IronWorker service
that makes working with the service a lot easier and more convenient.
It does, however, require you to have Ruby 1.9+ installed and to install the `iron_worker_ng` gem.
Once Ruby 1.9+ is installed, you can just the following command to get the gem:

<figcaption><span>Command Line </span></figcaption>
{% highlight bash %}
$ gem install iron_worker_ng
{% endhighlight %}

### Get the PHP Client Library

You can download the PHP client library, `iron_worker_php`, from [Github](https://github.com/iron-io/iron_worker_php). 
If you're using PHP 5.3 or greater, you can just download the 
`iron_worker.phar` file. If you're using an earlier version of PHP, you need to 
download the `IronWorker.class.php` file **and** the `IronCore.class.php` file 
from [here](https://github.com/iron-io/iron_core_php).

If you aren't sure which version of PHP you're using, you can run `php -v` from 
your shell to find out.

### Create Your Configuration File

The PHP library uses a configuration file or environment variables set that tell it what your credentials are.
We have some [pretty good documentation](/worker/reference/configuration) about how this works,
but for simplicity's sake, just save the following as `iron.json` in the same folder as your `.worker` file:

<figcaption><span>iron.json</span></figcaption>
{% highlight js %}
{
  "project_id": "INSERT YOUR PROJECT ID HERE",
  "token": "INSERT YOUR TOKEN HERE"
}
{% endhighlight %}

You should insert your [project ID](https://hud.iron.io) and [token](https://hud.iron.io/tokens) into that `iron.json` file.
Then, assuming you're running the commands from within the folder, the CLI will pick up your credentials and use them automatically.

### Write Your PHP Worker

Save the following as `hello_worker.php`:

<figcaption><span>hello_worker.php</span></figcaption>
{% highlight php %}
<?php
echo "Hello from PHP";
?>
{% endhighlight %}

### Create a .worker File

Worker files are a simple way to define your worker and its dependencies. Save the
following in a file called `hello.worker`

<figcaption><span>hello.worker</span></figcaption>
{% highlight ruby %}
# set the runtime language. PHP workers use "php"
runtime "php"
# exec is the file that will be executed:
exec "hello_worker.php"
{% endhighlight %}

You could include gems and other files in there too. [You can read more about .worker files here](/worker/reference/dotworker/).

### Upload the Worker

<figcaption><span>Command Line</span></figcaption>
{% highlight bash %}
$ iron_worker upload hello
{% endhighlight %}

That command will read your .worker file, create your worker code package and upload it to IronWorker.
Head over to [hud.iron.io](https://hud.iron.io), click the Worker link on your projects list, then click the Tasks tab.
You should see your new worker listed there with zero runs. Click on it to show the task list which will be empty, but not for long.

### Queue Up Tasks for Your Worker

Save the following as `enqueue.php`:

<figcaption><span>enqueue.php</span></figcaption>
{% highlight php %}
<?php
require("phar://iron_worker.phar");
/* If your PHP is less than 5.3,
   comment out the line above and uncomment the two following lines */
//require("IronWorker.class.php");
//require("IronCore.class.php");

$worker = new IronWorker();
$res = $worker->postTask("PHPWorker");
print_r($res);
?>
{% endhighlight %}

You can now queue up a task by calling `php enqueue.php` from your shell.

Another way is to use CLI:

<figcaption><span>Command Line</span></figcaption>
{% highlight bash %}
$ iron_worker queue hello
{% endhighlight %}

Now look at the task list in HUD and you should see your task show up and go from "queued" to "running" to "completed".

Now that we know it works, letâ€™s queue up a bunch of tasks from code.

<div class="alert">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once you upload a code package, you can queue as many tasks as you'd like against it.
You only need to re-upload the code package when your code changes.</p>
</div>

## Deep Dive

### Payload Example

Retrieving the payload in PHP is the same as it is on any other language. 
Retrieve the `-payload` argument passed to the script, load that file, and 
parse it as JSON.

Fortunately, the `iron_worker_php` library includes a helper function with 
your worker that makes this easy. Just call `getPayload();` to retrieve the 
payload.

<figcaption><span>hello_worker.php</span></figcaption>
{% highlight php %}
<?php
$payload = getPayload();
print_r($payload);
?>
{% endhighlight %}

### Environment

The PHP environment that the workers run in on IronWorker is as follows:

<table class="reference">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="width: 25%;">PHP Version</td>
      <td style="width: 75%;"><a href="http://php.net/downloads.php#v5" title="Version 5.3.6">Version 5.3.6</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="2" style="text-align: center; width: 100%;"><h4 style="padding: 0px;">Installed Modules</h4></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>php5-curl</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>php5-mysql</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>php5-gd</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>mongo</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

You can just use `require_once('{MODULE_NAME}');` to use these modules in your 
workers.

<div class="alert">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> While it is possible to use these modules without bundling 
them, we <i>highly recommend</i> that you include modules your code is reliant upon
in the code package whenever possible. Most of these modules are included in the 
environment because they are binary modules, making it impossible to supply them 
at runtime. The ones that are not binary modules are some of the more popular 
modules, which we include to allow users to try things out and test things with 
minimal setup and pain. We cannot guarantee which version of the module will be 
available, and we may update them without warning. Reliance on these modules may 
cause some unexpected conflicts in your code.</p>
