<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p>Workers are just sections of discrete, modular code that you queue tasks against. It's rare, though, that you want to run the same code repeatedly with no changes or variables. To address this, IronWorker has the concept of a "payload". The payload is the same thing, conceptually, as an argument or variable that is passed to a function, method, or command&mdash;just a piece of information you want to supply at runtime and make available in the worker itself.</p>

<h2>Typical Use</h2>

<p>Payloads are usually passed as a JSON-formatted string containing a JSON object of data you want to pass into your worker. This is so common, a lot of the client libraries (all the official client libraries, except the <a href="/worker/reference/cli">CLI</a>) will automatically convert whatever you pass them into a JSON-encoded string.</p>

<p>Some of the client libraries (<span class="fixed-width">iron_worker_php</span> and <span class="fixed-width">iron_worker_ng</span>, for Ruby workers only) will even parse the string for you inside the worker and make the data available through a function or a variable. In Ruby, you can access the payload through the <span class="fixed-width">params</span> variable in your worker. In PHP, you can access the payload using the following:</p>

{% highlight php %}
<?php
$args = getArgs();
?>
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Advanced Use</h2>

<p>Technically, your payload is just a string. You can send whatever you want, formatted however you want, as long as it fits within the <a href="/worker/reference/environment/#maximum_data_payload">request limits</a>.</p>

<p>If your client library doesn't automatically load the payload, or if you want to manually parse the payload, retrieving it takes a little more effort. The payload is stored in a file in the worker's directory when the worker is queued, and the location of that file is passed to the worker using the <span class="fixed-width">-payload</span> command line flag. To get the contents of your payload, you need to:

<ol>
	<li>Read the <span class="fixed-width">-payload</span> flag using <span class="fixed-width">argv</span> (or whatever your language uses to read command line flags).</li>
  <li>Open and read the file specified by the <span class="fixed-width">-payload</span> flag.</li>
  <li>Parse the contents of the file (if you encoded the payload when queuing the task).</li>
</ol>

<p>With that additional effort, however, you can use whatever payload formatting you prefer.</p>

<h2>Other Information</h2>

<p>Your worker will also be passed <span class="fixed-width">-id</span> and <span class="fixed-width">-d</span>. The value of <span class="fixed-width">id</span> will be the ID of the task that is currently being executed, and the value of <span class="fixed-width">-d</span> will be the user-writable directory that can be used for temporary storage for the duration of the task's execution.</p>
