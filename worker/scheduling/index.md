<p>IronWorker tasks are flexible; they don't have to be queued immediately. Rather, you can schedule a task to be queued at a specific time or after a set amount of time.

<p>Scheduled jobs are separate resources than queued tasks. When scheduled tasks run, they queue a task to execute the worker code. The Scheduled Task has a Scheduled ID. The task that executes is separate and has a distinct Task ID. You monitor Scheduled Tasks in the Schedule tab in the HUD. Tasks that subsequently queued can be monitored within the Task tab.</p>

		<p>Many Tasks To Run in Future - If you have lots of the same individual tasks to run in the future (sending emails to users, for example), we suggest <strong>not</strong> creating individual scheduled tasks (or queuing lots of tasks with delays). It's better to create a scheduled task that repeats on a regular basis. This scheduled task should then query a data base or datastore for the users to email (or actions to take). It can then spin up one or more sub-tasks to execute the work (creating one task per action or better yet, allocating a certain number of data slices to each task to better amortize the setup cost of a task).</p>
		<p>Here are a few posts on the topic:</p>

		<p>Finer-Grained Scheduling - There may be the need to run tasks on specific days or dates (end of month or Tuesday and Thursday). We recommend creating a scheduled job that runs frequently and then does a quick check to see if the scheduling condition is met. For example, running daily and checking if it's the last day of the month or a Tuesday or Thursday. If so, then continue with the task; if not, then exit. (We're looking at addressing finer-grain scheduling options but don't accommodate it at present.)</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<p>Specific times are expressed as time objects and so can be in UTC or local time. They'll be recorded in the system as UTC but displayed in the HUD/dashboard in the timezone that you specify for the HUD.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> Scheduled tasks may not be <em>executed</em> at the scheduled time; they will simply be placed on the queue at that time. Depending on the circumstances, a task may be executed a short time after it is scheduled to be. Tasks will never be executed before their schedule, however. (Scheduled tasks can be given a priority; higher priorities can reduce the time in queue.)</p>

<p>We've added a easy to use GUI to help you create and manage your schedules.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Click on the create schedule button on our schedule's page in the dashboard

	</li>
	<li>Fill in the relevant parameters for the scheduled task you want to create

	<li>Click on the create schedule button on our schedule's page in the dashboard
		<a href="/images/worker/scheduling/step3.png" target="_blank"><img style="max-width: 50%;" src="/images/worker/scheduling/step3.png" alt=""></a>
	</li>
	<li>You can now view your current, past, and deleted scheduled in the list view.

	</li>
	<li>If you click on a schedule you have the ability to view the details and edit/update your schedules accodingly. <strong>note:</strong> updating a schedule will delete the old one and create a new one.
