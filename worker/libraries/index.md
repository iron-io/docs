We will continue to add more clients for the REST/HTTP API. If you would like to see one in particular, please let us know.
We're also totally supportive if you want to build or modify client libraries yourself. Feel free to jump into our
[live chat support](http://get.iron.io/chat) for help. We love community involvement!
