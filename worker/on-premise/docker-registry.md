This will allow you to use a custom Docker Registry with an Iron On-Premise
installation.

There are two types of Docker registries, insecure and secure. The one which you
configure depends on your situation. Due to limitations on controlling domains
and certificates in an On Premise environment, we are only able to create an
insecure registry.

# Installation

The only difference in workflow between an insecure registry and a secure
registry is that you'll need to whitelist the registry from your local Docker
daemon.

To set up a registry with the On Premise Installer, simply include a
`[docker-registry]` host in your `./config/inventory.ini` with a proper server
IP and the Docker registry will be installed on that server.

```
[docker-registry]
192.168.x.x
```

This registry will serve on port `6000`.

# Usage

You will need to alter your local Docker before being able to push images to
this registry. This is a little different depending on your OS -- please see
[here](https://docs.docker.com/registry/insecure/) for how to set it up.

You can then Docker push `hello` to your insecure registry.

```
docker push 192.168.x.x:6000/hello
```

Then register this image with Iron.

```
iron register -name test 192.168.x.x:6000/hello
```

You can then queue tasks to run like this.

```
iron worker queue test
```

please see [this TL;DR](https://docs.docker.com/registry/#/tl-dr) from docker.
