Turnkey workers are pre-made workers you can add to your account and start using immediately. No coding required!
And it doesn't matter which language the workers are written in because you can queue up jobs for these workers from
any language using our API.

The basic usage for all of these is:

1. iron_worker upload http://github.com/PATH_TO_WORKER_FILE
2. Queue up tasks for the worker or schedule it.

That's it!  Super easy, super powerful. [See this blog post on shareable workers for more background.](https://blog.iron.io/sharable-open-source-workers-for)
