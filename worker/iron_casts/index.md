This page lists past IronCasts series. The screencasts are intended to be short and focused on some of the most commonly asked questions.

## [IronCast Series 1 - Introduction to IronWorker](http://blog.iron.io/search/label/Introduction%20to%20IronWorker)

In a series of four IronCasts, we will provide a high-level introduction to using IronWorker. IronWorker is an easy-to-use scalable task queue that gives cloud developers a simple way to offload front-end tasks, run scheduled jobs, and process tasks in the background and at scale.

These videocasts will cover core concepts including:
- [Deploying a worker](http://blog.iron.io/2013/09/ironcast-1-introduction-to-ironworker.html)
- Writing worker files to declare dependencies
- Test and prototype workers rapidly locally
- Connecting to a cloud development database

We will be using an example application which is written in Rails. However, the same concept applies to every language or framework. IronWorker can handle almost every language including binary files and so if you program in PHP,Python, Node.js, or other languages, don't worry, we have client libraries and examples to show you the way. It should also be possible to convert this example to the language of your choice without much effort. Please refer to further documentation here.
