Iron.io’s Org support allows you to set up one or more members of your team as the admins of your Iron.io account. As the admins, they will have the ability to create users, as well as control which projects each account has access to. This guide will walk you through the different options in Org Support and how to start using it. If you do not see this option, but would like to use this free feature, please contact <a href='mailto:support@iron.io'>support@iron.io</a>.

<h2 id="users">Users</h2>
When you first go to this page, you will see a list of all current users and what access they have. If this is a new account, you may only see one entry for the admin.<br />

<ul>
  <li><b>Admin</b>- This is the account type that can create projects and users and assign access.  We suggest using an address not tied to one specific person (for example, team@domain.com). This will avoid any access issues if that person is out of town.</li>
  <li><b>Admin RO</b>- This account has access to the Organization menu, but can not add or edit anything. It was designed to be used for finance teams or other people that need to see anything, but not make changes.</li>
  <li><b>Developer</b>- This is the standard Iron.io account. Users created as developers will only have access to the projects that the admin has given them.</li>
  <li><b>Accountant</b>- This is the account type that can manage billing information for Org Support account. Users created as accountants will only have access to the billing page and will not be able to access to projects and clusters of organization.</li>
</ul>
